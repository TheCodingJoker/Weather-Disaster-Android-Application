# Exit Dialog Implementation Complete! 🚪✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented exit confirmation dialogs across **ALL activities** in the app. When users click the back button (toolbar navigation or device back button), they now see a confirmation dialog before exiting the app.

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### **Exit Dialog Behavior:**
1. **Trigger**: Clicking toolbar back button OR device back button
2. **Dialog**: "Exit App" with message "Do you really want to leave the app?"
3. **Options**:
   - **Yes** → Calls `finishAffinity()` to completely destroy the app and all activities
   - **No** → Dismisses dialog and stays in the app
4. **Cancellable**: Users can tap outside dialog to cancel

## 📝 Code Implementation

### **Standard Implementation Pattern:**

```java
// 1. Add import
import androidx.appcompat.app.AlertDialog;

// 2. Setup toolbar to show exit dialog
private void setupToolbar() {
    setSupportActionBar(toolbar);
    toolbar.setNavigationOnClickListener(v -> showExitDialog());
}

// 3. Override back button
@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    showExitDialog();
}

// 4. Exit dialog method
private void showExitDialog() {
    new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
            .setTitle("Exit App")
            .setMessage("Do you really want to leave the app?")
            .setPositiveButton("Yes", (dialog, which) -> {
                // Exit the app completely
                finishAffinity();
            })
            .setNegativeButton("No", (dialog, which) -> {
                // Dismiss dialog
                dialog.dismiss();
            })
            .setCancelable(true)
            .show();
}
```
