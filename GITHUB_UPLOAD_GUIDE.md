# GitHub Upload Guide - API Keys Secured

All API keys have been successfully hidden and your codebase is now ready to upload to GitHub! üéâ

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. **API Keys Moved to local.properties**
All hardcoded API keys have been removed from the source code and moved to `local.properties`:
- ‚úÖ Gemini API Key (for AI features)
- ‚úÖ Google Places API Key (for location search)
- ‚úÖ Weatherbit API Key (for weather data)

### 2. **Build Configuration Updated**
- ‚úÖ `app/build.gradle.kts` now reads API keys from `local.properties`
- ‚úÖ API keys are exposed via `BuildConfig` class
- ‚úÖ Manifest placeholder for Google Places API key

### 3. **Source Code Updated**
All Java files now use `BuildConfig` to access API keys:
- ‚úÖ `GeminiApiService.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `LocationActivity.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `ForecastActivity.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `DashboardActivity.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `SettingsActivity.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `FarmerDashboardActivity.java` - Uses `BuildConfig.WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`

### 4. **.gitignore Updated**
Sensitive files are now excluded from version control:
```
local.properties
google-services.json
app/google-services.json
```

### 5. **Template Files Created**
- ‚úÖ `local.properties.template` - Template for API keys setup
- ‚úÖ `app/google-services.json.template` - Template for Firebase config

### 6. **Documentation Created**
- ‚úÖ `API_KEYS_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive guide for obtaining and configuring API keys

## üöÄ Before Uploading to GitHub

### Step 1: Clean Build Directory
Remove all build artifacts and generated files:
```bash
./gradlew clean
```

Or manually delete these directories:
- `app/build/`
- `.gradle/`

### Step 2: Verify .gitignore
Make sure these files are NOT being tracked:
```bash
git status
```

If you see `local.properties` or `google-services.json` in the output, they need to be removed from tracking:
```bash
git rm --cached local.properties
git rm --cached app/google-services.json
```

### Step 3: Test Build (Optional)
Verify the project still builds correctly:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## üì§ Uploading to GitHub

### Option 1: Create New Repository via GitHub Website

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository
2. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Disaster Detector Alert app (API keys secured)"
   ```

5. **Add remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DisasterDetectorAlert.git
   ```

6. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Add" ‚Üí "Add Existing Repository"
3. Select your project folder
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Uncheck "Keep this code private" (if you want it public)
6. Click "Publish Repository"

---

## üìã Files That WILL Be Uploaded (Public)

‚úÖ **Safe to upload:**
- All `.java` source files (API keys removed)
- All `.xml` layout and resource files
- `app/build.gradle.kts` (reads from local.properties)
- `.gitignore`
- `local.properties.template` (template only)
- `app/google-services.json.template` (template only)
- `API_KEYS_SETUP.md`
- All documentation files

---

## üîí Files That Will NOT Be Uploaded (Private)

These files are in `.gitignore` and will remain private:
- ‚ùå `local.properties` (contains your actual API keys)
- ‚ùå `app/google-services.json` (contains Firebase credentials)
- ‚ùå `build/` directory (generated files)
- ‚ùå `.gradle/` directory (build cache)
- ‚ùå `.idea/` directory (IDE settings)

---

## üë• For Other Developers Cloning Your Repository

Anyone who clones your repository will need to:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DisasterDetectorAlert.git
   ```

2. **Copy template file**:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.template local.properties
   ```

3. **Add their own API keys** to `local.properties`:
   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=their_gemini_key_here
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=their_places_key_here
   WEATHERBIT_API_KEY=their_weatherbit_key_here
   ```

4. **Copy Firebase template** (if using Firebase):
   ```bash
   cp app/google-services.json.template app/google-services.json
   ```
   Then fill in their Firebase credentials.

5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

They should refer to `API_KEYS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on obtaining API keys.

## üéØ What Your GitHub Repository Should Include

### Essential Files
- [x] Source code (`.java` files)
- [x] Layouts and resources (`.xml` files)
- [x] Build configuration (`build.gradle.kts`)
- [x] `.gitignore` (with API keys excluded)
- [x] `README.md` (create one if you haven't)

### Template Files
- [x] `local.properties.template`
- [x] `app/google-services.json.template`

### Documentation
- [x] `API_KEYS_SETUP.md`

---

## üìù Recommended README.md Content

Create a `README.md` file in your project root with:

```markdown

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Reminders

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Rotate API keys** if they were previously exposed
3. **Set up API restrictions** in Google Cloud Console and other platforms
4. **Monitor API usage** to detect unauthorized access
5. **Keep local.properties private** - never share it

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" after uploading
- Make sure you've set up `local.properties` with your keys
- Run `./gradlew clean build`

### Git still tracking local.properties
```bash
git rm --cached local.properties
git commit -m "Remove local.properties from tracking"
```

### Someone cloned but can't build
- Direct them to `API_KEYS_SETUP.md`
- Ensure `local.properties.template` is in the repository

---

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist Before Upload

- [ ] All API keys removed from source code
- [ ] `local.properties` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `google-services.json` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Template files created
- [ ] Build directory cleaned (`./gradlew clean`)
- [ ] Documentation complete
